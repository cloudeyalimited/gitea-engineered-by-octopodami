# Gitea Engineered by OCTOPODAMI (GEBO) Setup

Our pre-configured stack relies on AWS EC2 which helps to improve performance and scalability of your Gitea instance, but additional integration with other AWS services like S3, CloudFront, Route53, and Auto Scaling is possible.

## Preliminary Setup

You need to create a unique EC2 Key Pair so you can log into your EC2 instance easily. Within the AWS Management Console:

1. Go to **EC2** > **Network & Security** > **Key Pairs**
2. Click **Create Key Pair**
3. Enter a Key pair name and click **Create**
4. Download your Key pair with a **.pem** extension and store it in a safe place on your computer.

## Launch Instance

Within the EC2 Dashboard page, you can do the following to launch a Gitea Engineered by OCTOPODAMI (GEBO) instance:

1. Click the **Launch Instance** button or click this button [![Launch Stack](./images/launch-stack.png?raw=true)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-icx22qpp2vkv2)
2. Next, click **AWS Marketplace** tab on the left side of the **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** page
3. Enter the phrase **octopodami** in the search box and press **enter** on your keyboard
4. Click the **select** button in front of Gitea Engineered by OCTOPODAMIÂ®
5. Click the **continue** button in the dialog box
6. Select an instance type that fits your budget then click the **Review and Launch** button
7. Configure these options (**Security Groups**, **Instance Details**, **Storage**, and **Tags**) to match your business needs
8. Click the **launch** button

## Setup Your Gitea Instance

Within the EC2 Dashboard page, click **Instance** to view your running instance, if any.

1. Select the instance you launched to view its detailed descriptions
2. Click the icon in front of **IPv4 Public IP** to copy the IP Address of the server to clipboard
3. Paste the IP Address in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, and IE. e.t.c.) on port 3000 (e.g., http://your-ip:3000)
4. You will be presented with the initial Gitea setup screen

5. Copy the **Instance ID** from your EC2 dashboard, paste it in the input field and click the **Unlock Octopodami** button to proceed
6. That's all you have to do. You will now be able to access your new Gitea instance at http://your-instance-ip:3000
7. Your login credential is available here in the EC2 Instance: `sudo cat /root/.gitea-credentials`

**Please Note**: the IP Address above is not a real one -- yours will be unique. :wink:

Use the credentials you provided during setup to access the Gitea admin console. You can now create repositories, manage users, and configure your Git server.
